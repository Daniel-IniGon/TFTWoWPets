Autochess with the wow pets. 

I think this is what some of the fans of blizzard expected from them when auto chess genre became so popular. 
So I created my own approach. This project does not meant to be a complete game, but a funny way to test the skills I've been learning so far.

I learnt so many things putting all this together in a single project. The most important one this time was to keep it as simple as you can! Be kind to your future you, will be grateful! 

I hope you find this game as enjoyable as much I enjoyed doing it!

If you have some feedback do not hesitate and reach me by mail.
